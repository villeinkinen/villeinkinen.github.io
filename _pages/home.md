I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute at the University of Exeter Business School. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Gothenburg in 2023.

I specialize in environmental economics and policy, and my current research focuses on biodiversity conservation and land use. I combine microeconometric methods and quasi-experimental research designs with geospatial data analysis.

Before my education in economics, I obtained a Master of Laws degree from the University of Helsinki, and I worked at the Finnish Ministry of the Environment where I advised on matters related to EU environmental policy and law.

## Work in progress


_Evaluation of Wetland Area Gains and Losses under the US Clean Water Act_ (Job market paper. With Jessica Coria, João Vaz, and Yann Clough) ([Link](/assets/pdf/JMP.pdf))

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Offsetting policies reconcile development and conservation objectives by allowing environmental losses in some locations, given that the losses are compensated with equivalent gains elsewhere. We quantify net losses of wetland area under the US Clean Water Act compensatory mitigation program, which is the most extensive and longest-running environmental offsetting program in the world. A unique feature of the program is how most of the compensation is financed through a market mechanism where permittees purchase compensation credits that specialized firms have generated from wetland restoration activities. We measure environmental outcomes at these restoration sites using high-resolution satellite imagery and land cover change data. In particular, we measure wetland area gains at 400 restoration sites that were established over 1995–2020. Comparing realized compensation projects to planned but withdrawn projects in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the majority of the environmental gains would not have occurred in absence of dedicated conservation activities. We also find that the market mechanism allocates the type and location of conservation activities according to the opportunity cost of land use. Nonetheless, the wetland area gains appear insufficient to compensate for the wetland area losses regulated within the program. This makes it unlikely that the program will achieve its environmental goals in the long term.</span> 

_The Choice of Mechanism for Biodiversity Offsetting_ (with Jessica Coria and João Vaz)

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Policy makers worldwide are giving increasing attention to the use of markets for offsetting biodiversity losses from development projects. It is unclear whether market-based instruments, such as banking mechanisms that entail third-party offsets for developers to purchase, hold significant promise for implementing no-net-loss regulation at least cost, relative to the conventional command-and-control approach of developer-led offsets. In this paper, we provide a theoretical examination of the costs and benefits of the two approaches. We find that (1) if offsets by banks are of insufficient quality relative to developer-led offsets, a large enough market could compensate for the lack of equivalency due to cost-savings from market expansion, and (2) if entry costs are positively correlated with restoration quality, the market could hold banks of low quality, which is an outcome that favors the relative performance of developer-led offsets. We illustrate our results in the case of the US wetland mitigation program and find evidence that differentials on offset quality and the opportunity cost of land use are significant drivers of the choice of offsetting mechanism.</span> 

_The Effect of Water Resource Protection on Construction Employment in the United States_

<span style="font-size: 14px;">The Clean Water Rule, an executive order enacted in 2015, expanded the scope of waters that are federally protected under the Clean Water Act. I use a difference-in-differences framework to compare construction employment between the 22 states where the Rule was implemented and the 28 states where it was never implemented due to litigation in regional courts. I find that the overall effect of the Rule on construction employment was negligible, likely due to how states with stringent pre-existing state-level regulations selected into implementing the Rule. However, a negative effect appears in states that had unsuccessfully litigated against the Rule. Furthermore, the decrease in construction activity was most prominent in counties where low-cost compliance options through environmental offset markets were limited. The regulator should take steps to avoid supply shortages and monopolistic conditions in the compensation credit market without compromising its environmental integrity.</span>
