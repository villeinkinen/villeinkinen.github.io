Step-by-step instructions:

Fork the minimal mistakes repo: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes

Add the following line to Gemfile:
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"

Make edits to _config.yml; add pics etc to assets folder

Subpages: Add .md to _pages; make corresponding edits to _navigation.yml
- See how the header is written in the .md documents

Delete index.html; jekyll will now look for home.md in _pages

How to make global edits to font size etc:
- Navigate to assets/css/main.scss
- See how I changed the font size for the archive class
- I found this class with inspect (you need to find the class for the element you want to modify)
- Things inserted in main.scss seem to override pre-existing settings elsewhere in the template

Bio pic size:
- Same method; but I took the settings directly from _sidebar.scss
- In the original file I left them unmodified, and then inserted the modifications in main.scss

### Welcome

Hi! This is the first draft of my personal webpage. I will add more content during the coming days.

### About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute at the University of Exeter Business School.

I specialize in environmental economics and I also have a broad interest in public economics. My current research focuses on biodiversity conservation and land use. Methodologically, I combine microeconometrics and quasi-experimental research designs with geospatial data analysis.
