Welcome! This is the first draft of my personal webpage. I will keep adding more content during the coming days.

### About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute at the University of Exeter Business School.

I specialize in environmental economics, and my current research focuses on biodiversity conservation and land use. Methodologically, I combine microeconometrics and quasi-experimental research designs with geospatial data analysis.
