### About

Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute at the University of Exeter Business School.

I specialize in environmental economics, and my current research focuses on biodiversity conservation and land use. I combine microeconometric methods and quasi-experimental research designs with geospatial data analysis.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).


### Work in progress

_Evaluation of Wetland Area Gains and Losses under the US Clean Water Act_ (with Jessica Coria, João Vaz, and Yann Clough.)

<span style="font-size: 14px;">We evaluate the environmental performance of the market-based environmental offsetting program opearting under the US Clean Water Act. We delineate wetland area gains at wetland restoration sites using imagery and then assess the timing of the gains using land cover change detection data from the USGS. As the timing of the wetland area gains coincides with enrollment into the offsetting program, we find that the observed gains are largely additional. However, our findings also suggest that the offsetting program is&mdash;contrary to its stated objectives&mdash;resulting in net loss of wetland area.</span> 

_The Choice of Mechanism for Biodiversity Offsetting_ (with Jessica Coria and João Vaz.)

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Policy makers worldwide are giving increasing attention to the use of markets for offsetting biodiversity losses from development projects. It is unclear whether market-based instruments, such as banking mechanisms that entail third-party offsets for developers to purchase, hold significant promise for implementing no-net-loss regulation at least cost, relative to the conventional command-and-control approach of developer-led offsets. In this paper, we provide a theoretical examination of the costs and benefits of the two approaches. We find that (1) if offsets by banks are of insufficient quality relative to developer-led offsets, a large enough market could compensate for the lack of equivalency due to cost-savings from market expansion, and (2) if entry costs are positively correlated with restoration quality, the market could hold banks of low quality, which is an outcome that favors the relative performance of developer-led offsets. We illustrate our results in the case of the US wetland mitigation program and find evidence that differentials on offset quality and the opportunity cost of land are significant drivers of the choice of offsetting mechanism.</span> 

_The Effect of Water Resource Protection on Construction Employment in the United States_

<span style="font-size: 14px;">The Clean Water Rule, an executive order enacted in 2015, expanded the scope of waters that are federally protected under the Clean Water Act. I use a difference-in-differences framework to compare construction employment between the 22 states where the Rule was implemented and the 28 states where it was never implemented due to litigation in regional courts. I find that the overall effect of the Rule on construction employment was negligible. However, a negative effect appears in states that had unsuccessfully litigated against the Rule. Furthermore, the decrease in construction activity was most prominent in counties where low-cost compliance options through environmental offset markets were limited.</span>
