### _Evaluation of Wetland Area Gains and Losses under the US Clean Water Act_

(Work in progress, with Jessica Coria, João Vaz, and Yann Clough)

In this paper, we evaluate the environmental performance of the market-based environmental offsetting program opearting under the US Clean Water Act. In particular, we delineate wetland area gains at wetland restoration sites and assess the additionality of wetland area gains against various counterfactual scenarios. While we find that the observed gains are largely additional, it appears that the regulatory program is&mdash;contrary to its stated objectives&mdash;resulting in net loss of wetland area.
