<!--

Step-by-step instructions:

Fork the minimal mistakes repo: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes

Add the following line to Gemfile:
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"

Make edits to _config.yml; add pics etc to assets folder

Subpages: Add .md to _pages; make corresponding edits to _navigation.yml
- See how the header is written in the .md documents

Delete index.html; jekyll will now look for home.md in _pages

Delete files as indicated here: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/
- Under the header "Remove the Unnecessary"

How to make global edits to font size etc:
- Navigate to assets/css/main.scss
- See how I changed the font size for the archive class
- I found this class with inspect (you need to find the class for the element you want to modify)
- Things inserted in main.scss seem to override pre-existing settings elsewhere in the template

Bio pic size:
- Same method; but I took the settings directly from _sidebar.scss
- In the original file I left them unmodified, and then inserted the modifications in main.scss

Bio pic stop fade at mouseover:
- https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/avatar-image-changes-color-on-mouseover/7798/4
- To stop the fade at mouseover:
	- In _sass/minimal_mistakes/_sidebar.css, copy .sidebar to main.scss
	- In main.scss, change "opacity: 0.75" to "opacity: 1"
- To disable the pic from being a link:
	- In _includes/author-profile.html

	{% if author.avatar %}
	    <div class="author__avatar">
	      <a href="{{ author.home | default: '/' | absolute_url }}">
	        <img src="{{ author.avatar | relative_url }}" alt="{{ author.name }}" itemprop="image" class="u-photo">
	      </a>
	    </div>
	  {% endif %}

Google Search:
- In _config.yml, to verify domain ownership, insert the code from google:
- google_site_verification : "IXghBQ3KNrCXChHHSRc8lXktBHbliKWRKnpaSuTbDGY"
- NOT WORKING ATM
